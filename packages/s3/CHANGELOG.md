# @noy-db/s3

## 2.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 41fa3f6: Add the noy-db brand logo (yellow "dead-end" road sign) to the main README and verify the full automated release workflow end-to-end (changesets → Version Packages PR → npm publish → GitHub Release).

  No code changes — this release exercises the publish pipeline.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [41fa3f6]
  - @noy-db/core@2.0.0

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Align folder names with npm package names and bring metadata to state-of-the-art quality.

  **Folder rename (no code changes):**

  - `packages/adapter-browser` → `packages/browser`
  - `packages/adapter-dynamo` → `packages/dynamo`
  - `packages/adapter-file` → `packages/file`
  - `packages/adapter-memory` → `packages/memory`
  - `packages/adapter-s3` → `packages/s3`

  **package.json metadata improvements:**

  - Added `author`, `homepage`, `bugs` fields to every package
  - Added `sideEffects: false` for proper tree-shaking
  - Added comprehensive `keywords` to every package (previously only `@noy-db/core` had any)
  - Fixed descriptions — replaced "NOYDB" with "noy-db"
  - Fixed all `repository.directory` paths after folder rename
  - Fixed `homepage` URLs — previously pointed to the old `noydb` repo

  **New per-package READMEs:**
  Every published package now ships with its own `README.md` and `LICENSE`, so npmjs.com displays proper documentation instead of a blank page.

  **GitHub Actions:**

  - Release workflow now supports two paths: changesets-driven (push to main) and release-event-driven (manual GitHub Release)
  - Publishes now include npm provenance attestations for supply-chain verification
  - `createGithubReleases: true` enabled on the changesets action

  No API or runtime behavior changes.

- Updated dependencies
  - @noy-db/core@0.1.1
