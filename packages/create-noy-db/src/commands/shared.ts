/**
 * Shared primitives for the interactive `noy-db` subcommands that
 * need to unlock a real vault.
 *
 * Three things live here:
 *
 *   1. `ReadPassphrase` — a tiny interface for "prompt the user for
 *      a passphrase", with a test-friendly default. Subcommands take
 *      this as an injected dependency so tests can short-circuit
 *      the prompt without spawning a pty.
 *
 *   2. `defaultReadPassphrase` — the production implementation,
 *      built on `@clack/prompts` `password()`. Never echoes the
 *      value to the terminal, never logs it, clears it from the
 *      returned promise after the caller consumes it.
 *
 *   3. `assertRole` — narrow unknown string input to the Role type
 *      with a consistent error message.
 *
 * ## Why pull this out
 *
 * `rotate`, `addUser`, and `backup` all need the same "prompt for
 * a passphrase" shape and the same "open a file adapter and get
 * back a Noydb instance" shape. Duplicating it in three files would
 * drift over time; centralizing means one place to audit the
 * passphrase-handling contract (never log, never persist, clear
 * local variables after use).
