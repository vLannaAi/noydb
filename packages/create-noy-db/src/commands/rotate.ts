/**
 * `noy-db rotate` — rotate the DEKs for one or more collections in
 * a vault.
 *
 * What it does
 * ------------
 * For each target collection:
 *
 *   1. Generate a fresh DEK
 *   2. Decrypt every record with the old DEK
 *   3. Re-encrypt every record with the new DEK
 *   4. Re-wrap the new DEK into every remaining user's keyring
 *
 * The old DEKs become unreachable as soon as the keyring files are
 * updated. This is the "just rotate" path — nobody is revoked,
 * everybody keeps their current permissions, but the key material
 * is replaced.
 *
 * Why expose this as a CLI command
 * --------------------------------
 * Two real-world scenarios:
 *
 *   1. **Suspected key leak.** An operator lost a laptop, a
 *      developer accidentally pasted a passphrase into a Slack
 *      channel, a USB stick went missing. Even if you think the
 *      passphrase is safe, rotating is cheap insurance.
 *
 *   2. **Scheduled rotation.** Some compliance regimes require
 *      periodic key rotation regardless of exposure. A CLI makes
 *      this scriptable from cron or a CI job.
 *
 * This module is test-first: all inputs are plain options, the
 * passphrase reader is injected, and the Noydb factory is
 * injectable. The production bin is a thin wrapper that defaults
 * those injections to their real implementations.
