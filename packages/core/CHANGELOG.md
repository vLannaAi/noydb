## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes — Core enhancements + scaffolder polish

The v0.5 release ships three substantive feature landings in `@noy-db/core` plus the scaffolder polish work tracked separately in `@noy-db/create`. Everything is purely additive except for one documented breaking change: the v0.4 owner-only `Compartment.export()` method has been removed and replaced with the strictly more capable `exportStream()` + `exportJSON()` pair.

- **`exportStream()` and `exportJSON()` — authorization-aware plaintext export** (#72). Replaces the v0.4 owner-only `Compartment.export()` with two new APIs that solve the problems consumers actually have: ACL-scoped iteration (collections the caller cannot read are silently skipped, same rule as `Collection.list()`), schema and refs metadata surfaced on every chunk for downstream serializers, and streaming output so large compartments don't have to be materialized as a single value. `exportStream(opts?)` is an `AsyncIterableIterator<ExportChunk>` with opt-in per-record granularity (`{ granularity: 'record' }`) and opt-in ledger head (`{ withLedgerHead: true }`). `exportJSON(opts?)` is the universal default helper that returns a `Promise<string>` with a stable on-disk shape — core stays zero `node:` imports, so the consumer chooses any sink (`fs.writeFile`, `Blob` download, `fetch` upload, IndexedDB) and the destination decision stays explicit at the call site. Both APIs carry an explicit plaintext-on-disk warning in JSDoc and README. New exports: `ExportStreamOptions`, `ExportChunk<T>`. New method on `Collection`: `getSchema()` (read-only getter for the attached Standard Schema validator, added so the compartment-level exporter can surface schemas without reaching into private fields). **Breaking:** `Compartment.export()` removed. One-line migration: `comp.export()` → `comp.exportJSON()`. The old method was owner-only; the new one is ACL-scoped, so non-owners now get an export of just the collections they can read instead of a `PermissionDeniedError`.

- **Admin can grant another admin — bounded lateral delegation** (#62). The v0.4 rule was "only `owner` can grant `admin`," which bottlenecked every admin onboarding through the single owner principal and left a single-owner bus-factor risk unresolved even when multiple trusted humans existed. v0.5 opens up admin↔admin lateral delegation with two guardrails. **Guardrail 1:** `grant()` now validates that every DEK wrapped into the new keyring comes from the grantor's own DEK set; widening grants throw the new `PrivilegeEscalationError`. Structurally trivially satisfied under the v0.5 admin model (admin grants always inherit the full caller DEK set) but wired in so future per-collection admin scoping cannot accidentally bypass the subset rule. **Guardrail 2:** new `RevokeOptions.cascade` field (`'strict'` default, `'warn'` opt-in) controls what happens when an admin who has granted other admins is revoked. In strict mode every admin they transitively granted is revoked too, walking the `granted_by` parent pointer already recorded on every keyring file — no on-disk format change. A single key-rotation pass at the end covers the union of affected collections across the cascade, so cost is O(records in affected collections), not O(records × cascade depth). In warn mode the descendants are left in place and a single `console.warn` lists every orphan by id. Owner is still unrevocable. New exports: `PrivilegeEscalationError`.

- **Cross-compartment role-scoped queries — `listAccessibleCompartments()` and `queryAcross()`** (#63). Two new top-level `Noydb` methods enable consolidated views across the compartments a single principal can unwrap, removing the bottleneck where multi-tenant consumers had to track the compartment list out of band. `listAccessibleCompartments({ minRole? })` enumerates every compartment where the calling principal can unwrap a keyring at the requested minimum role — compartments where the user has no keyring file (`NoAccessError`) or where the passphrase doesn't unwrap (`InvalidKeyError`) are silently dropped from the result, preserving the existence-leak guarantee. A small performance bonus: every compartment whose keyring is successfully unwrapped during the probe is opportunistically primed in the keyring cache, so a subsequent `openCompartment(id)` doesn't have to re-derive the KEK. `queryAcross(ids, fn, { concurrency? })` is pure orchestration over `openCompartment()` with per-compartment error capture (one compartment's callback throwing does NOT abort the others) and an inline p-limit-style scheduler (no external dep) that preserves caller-supplied result order under concurrency > 1. Default concurrency is `1` (sequential) — conservative for cloud adapters. Composes with `exportStream()` for cross-compartment plaintext export — the moment you have both primitives, the cross-tenant export story falls out without any new code. **Adapter contract:** new optional 7th method `NoydbAdapter.listCompartments?(): Promise<string[]>`. The 6-method core contract is unchanged; this is an additive optional extension discovered via `'listCompartments' in adapter`, the same pattern as `listPage`. Memory and file adapters implement it; browser/dynamo/s3 do not in v0.5 (cloud enumeration needs a GSI or list-bucket permission configured by the consumer). Calling `listAccessibleCompartments()` against an adapter without the capability throws the new `AdapterCapabilityError`. New exports: `AccessibleCompartment`, `ListAccessibleCompartmentsOptions`, `QueryAcrossOptions`, `QueryAcrossResult<T>`, `AdapterCapabilityError`. **Known v0.4 edge case documented, not fixed in this release:** a compartment whose keyring file happens to have an empty wrapped-DEKs map will pass the `loadKeyring` probe with any passphrase (nothing to integrity-check against). This is a metadata leak — compartment name + user-id — not a content leak, because the principal's DEK set is empty. Hardening via a passphrase canary in the keyring file format is tracked as a v0.6+ follow-up. The limitation is documented in the `listAccessibleCompartments()` JSDoc.

- **CLI subcommands: `rotate`, `add-user`, `backup`** (#38). Three new subcommands on the `noy-db` bin that wrap the corresponding `@noy-db/core` APIs so operators can manage a compartment from the command line without writing TypeScript. New exports on `@noy-db/core`: `rotate()`, `addUser()`, `backup()`, `verifyIntegrity()`, plus the shared `assertRole()`, `parseCollectionList()`, and `readPassphrase` types used by the bin. These are the programmatic counterparts to the CLI subcommands — downstream tooling (devtools, IDE extensions, future `nuxi` CLI extension) can call them directly without spawning a child process.

### Stats

- 403 tests in `@noy-db/core` (was 376 at v0.4 ship); +27 across the v0.5 epic
- 720 tests across the monorepo
- Zero new runtime dependencies — every v0.5 feature is pure orchestration over existing primitives

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- **Peer dep fix**: changed `peerDependencies` spec from `workspace:*` to `workspace:^` so published packages accept any semver-compatible `@noy-db/*` version rather than pinning to the exact version the workspace was built against. Without this fix, installing `@noy-db/core@0.4.0` alongside `@noy-db/memory@0.3.0` produced an `ERESOLVE` error because memory's peer dep was published as the literal `"0.3.0"` string.

- **Version line unified**: every `@noy-db/*` package is now on the **0.4.1** line. Previously the line was mixed (core/pinia on 0.4.0, adapters on 0.3.0, vue on 0.2.0, create on 0.3.2). No functional code changes — this is a manifest-only release to make v0.4 actually installable.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes — Integrity & trust

The v0.4 release adds the **integrity** layer on top of v0.3's adoption surface. Five new features land together; every record can now be schema-validated, every mutation is recorded in a tamper-evident hash-chained ledger, history is delta-encoded for storage efficiency, soft FK references are enforceable per-collection, and backups verify end-to-end on load.

- **Schema validation via Standard Schema v1** (#42). Attach any [Standard Schema v1](https://standardschema.dev) validator (Zod, Valibot, ArkType, Effect Schema) to a `Collection` or `defineNoydbStore`. Validation runs **before encryption on `put()`** (rejecting bad input with the validator's full issue list) and **after decryption on every read** (catching stored data that has drifted from the current schema). New exports: `StandardSchemaV1`, `StandardSchemaV1Issue`, `InferOutput`, `validateSchemaInput`, `validateSchemaOutput`, `SchemaValidationError`. History reads (`getVersion`, `history`) intentionally skip validation.

- **Hash-chained audit log (the ledger)** (#43). Every `Collection.put` and `Collection.delete` appends an encrypted entry to the compartment's `_ledger/` internal collection. Entries are linked by `prevHash = sha256(canonicalJson(previousEntry))` so any tampering breaks the chain. `payloadHash` is over the **encrypted** envelope, not plaintext, preserving zero-knowledge. `Compartment.ledger()` returns a `LedgerStore` with `head()`, `entries({ from, to })`, `verify()`, `loadAllEntries()`. New exports: `LedgerStore`, `LedgerEntry`, `VerifyResult`, `AppendInput`, `LEDGER_COLLECTION`, `canonicalJson`, `sha256Hex`, `hashEntry`, `paddedIndex`, `parseIndex`, `envelopePayloadHash`. Side fix: `grant()` now propagates ALL system-prefixed collection DEKs (`_ledger`, `_history`, `_sync`) to every grant target so operators with write access on a single collection can append to the shared ledger.

- **Delta history via RFC 6902 JSON Patch** (#44). Every put after the genesis computes a **reverse** JSON Patch from the new record to the previous version and stores it in `_ledger_deltas/`. New `LedgerStore.reconstruct(collection, id, current, atVersion)` walks the chain backward from the current state, applying reverse patches to rebuild any historical version. Storage scales with edit size, not record size — a 1 KB record edited 100 times costs ~1 KB of deltas, not 100 KB of snapshots. Hand-rolled JSON Patch implementation (subset: add/remove/replace; arrays atomic; RFC 6902 path escaping); zero deps. New exports: `JsonPatch`, `JsonPatchOp`, `computePatch`, `applyPatch`, `LEDGER_DELTAS_COLLECTION`. Known limitation: ambiguous across delete+recreate cycles because version counters reset.

- **Foreign-key references via `ref()`** (#45). Soft FK enforcement at the collection level. Three modes: **`strict`** (default — put rejects missing target, delete of target rejects with referencing records), **`warn`** (both succeed, `checkIntegrity()` surfaces orphans), **`cascade`** (delete of target propagates with cycle-safe termination). New exports: `ref(target, mode?)`, `RefRegistry`, `RefIntegrityError`, `RefScopeError`, `RefMode`, `RefDescriptor`, `RefViolation`. New method: `Compartment.checkIntegrity()`. Cross-compartment refs rejected at construction with `RefScopeError`.

- **Verifiable backups** (#46). `dump()` embeds the current ledger head + the full `_ledger` and `_ledger_deltas` internal collections so the receiver can replay the chain. `load()` re-runs verification after restoring and rejects any backup whose chain or data has been tampered with. New `Compartment.verifyBackupIntegrity()` method runs both `ledger.verify()` AND a data envelope cross-check (recomputes `payloadHash` for every current record and compares to the latest matching ledger entry) — catches three independent attack surfaces: chain tampering, ciphertext substitution, and out-of-band writes that bypassed `Collection.put`. New exports: `BackupLedgerError`, `BackupCorruptedError`. Backwards compat: pre-v0.4 backups load with a console warning and skip the integrity check.

  **Side fix**: encrypted dump→load round-trips work for the first time. The old `load()` restored a different keyring file but the in-memory `Compartment.keyring` still held the pre-load session's DEKs. New `reloadKeyring` callback wired through Noydb → Compartment refreshes the in-memory keyring from the freshly-loaded keyring file using the active user's passphrase.

### Stats

- 376 tests in `@noy-db/core` (was 269 at v0.3 ship); +107 across the v0.4 epic
- 654 tests across the monorepo
- Zero new runtime dependencies — Standard Schema and JSON Patch are both vendored as types-only / hand-rolled

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- **Reactive query DSL** (closes #12). New `collection.query()` returns a chainable `Query<T>` builder with operators `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `in`, `contains`, `startsWith`, `between`, plus a `.filter(fn)` escape hatch and `.and()`/`.or()` composition. Terminal methods: `.toArray()`, `.first()`, `.count()`, `.subscribe()`, `.toPlan()`. Plans are JSON-serializable for devtools and Web Worker offloading. All filtering runs client-side after decryption — preserves zero-knowledge. The legacy predicate form `collection.query(fn)` is still supported as an overload for backward compatibility.

- **Secondary indexes** (closes #13). Declare indexes per-collection via `indexes: ['status', 'clientId']`. Built client-side from decrypted records, kept in memory only. The query planner uses them to turn equality and `in` clauses into O(1) hash lookups, then filters the candidate set for the remaining clauses. Benchmark: 4–6× speedup vs linear scan on a 10K-record collection. No plaintext indexes ever touch the adapter.

- **Pagination via `listPage` + streaming `scan()`** (closes #14). New optional `listPage` adapter capability for cursor-based pagination. `Collection.scan()` returns an `AsyncIterableIterator<T>` for memory-bounded iteration over very large collections — bypasses the LRU entirely, peak memory under 200 MB on a 100K-record collection.

- **Lazy hydration + LRU eviction** (closes #15). New `cache: { maxRecords, maxBytes }` collection option enables lazy mode: `get(id)` hits the adapter on miss and populates an LRU; `list()` and `query()` throw (use `scan()` or `loadMore()`); declaring `indexes` is rejected at construction. `prefetch: true` restores the v0.2 eager behavior. Eviction is O(1) via `Map` + delete/set promotion. Cache budgets accept `'50MB'`, `'2GB'`, or a number of bytes.

- Docs sweep — getting-started, end-user-features, architecture, adapters, deployment-profiles, and the README all updated with v0.3 examples. Bug fix: 80+ stale `@noydb/*` references corrected to `@noy-db/*`.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

Previous `0.1.x` versions have been deprecated on npm. Please install `>=0.2.0`.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Align folder names with npm package names and bring metadata to state-of-the-art quality.

  **Folder rename (no code changes):**

  - `packages/adapter-browser` → `packages/browser`
  - `packages/adapter-dynamo` → `packages/dynamo`
  - `packages/adapter-file` → `packages/file`
  - `packages/adapter-memory` → `packages/memory`
  - `packages/adapter-s3` → `packages/s3`

  **package.json metadata improvements:**

  - Added `author`, `homepage`, `bugs` fields to every package
  - Added `sideEffects: false` for proper tree-shaking
  - Added comprehensive `keywords` to every package (previously only `@noy-db/core` had any)
  - Fixed descriptions — replaced "NOYDB" with "noy-db"
  - Fixed all `repository.directory` paths after folder rename
  - Fixed `homepage` URLs — previously pointed to the old `noydb` repo

  **New per-package READMEs:**
  Every published package now ships with its own `README.md` and `LICENSE`, so npmjs.com displays proper documentation instead of a blank page.

  **GitHub Actions:**

  - Release workflow now supports two paths: changesets-driven (push to main) and release-event-driven (manual GitHub Release)
  - Publishes now include npm provenance attestations for supply-chain verification
  - `createGithubReleases: true` enabled on the changesets action

  No API or runtime behavior changes.
