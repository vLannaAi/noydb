/**
 * Ledger entry shape + canonical JSON + sha256 helpers.
 *
 * This file holds the PURE primitives used by the hash-chained ledger:
 * the entry type, the deterministic (sort-stable) JSON encoder, and
 * the sha256 hasher that produces `prevHash` and `ledger.head()`.
 *
 * Everything here is validator-free and side-effect free — the only
 * runtime dep is Web Crypto's `subtle.digest` for the sha256 call,
 * which we already use for every other hashing operation in the core.
 *
 * The hash chain property works like this:
 *
 *   hash(entry[i])       = sha256(canonicalJSON(entry[i]))
 *   entry[i+1].prevHash  = hash(entry[i])
 *
 * Any modification to `entry[i]` (field values, field order, whitespace)
 * produces a different `hash(entry[i])`, which means `entry[i+1]`'s
 * stored `prevHash` no longer matches the recomputed hash, which means
 * `verify()` returns `{ ok: false, divergedAt: i + 1 }`. The chain is
 * append-only and tamper-evident without external anchoring.

/**
 * A single ledger entry in its plaintext form — what gets serialized,
 * hashed, and then encrypted with the ledger DEK before being written
 * to the `_ledger/` adapter collection.
 *
 * ## Why hash the ciphertext, not the plaintext?
 *
 * `payloadHash` is the sha256 of the record's ENCRYPTED envelope bytes,
 * not its plaintext. This matters:
 *
 *   1. **Zero-knowledge preserved.** A user (or a third party) can
 *      verify the ledger against the stored envelopes without any
 *      decryption keys. The adapter layer already holds only
 *      ciphertext, so hashing the ciphertext keeps the ledger at the
 *      same privacy level as the adapter.
 *
 *   2. **Determinism.** Plaintext → ciphertext is randomized by the
 *      fresh per-write IV, so `hash(plaintext)` would need extra
 *      normalization. `hash(ciphertext)` is already deterministic and
 *      unique per write.
 *
 *   3. **Detection property.** If an attacker modifies even one byte of
 *      the stored ciphertext (trying to flip a record), the hash
 *      changes, the ledger's recorded `payloadHash` no longer matches,
 *      and a data-integrity check fails. We don't do that check in
 *      `verify()` today (v0.4 only checks chain consistency), but the
 *      hook is there for a future `verifyIntegrity()` follow-up.
 *
 * Fields marked `op`, `collection`, `id`, `version`, `ts`, `actor` are
 * plaintext METADATA about the operation — NOT the record itself. The
 * entry is still encrypted at rest via the ledger DEK, but adapters
 * could theoretically infer operation patterns from the sizes and
 * timestamps. This is an accepted trade-off for the tamper-evidence
 * property; full ORAM-level privacy is out of scope for noy-db.

 * every time, on every machine, for the same logical entry — otherwise
 * `verify()` would return `{ ok: false }` on cross-platform reads.

 * JavaScript's `JSON.stringify` is almost canonical, but NOT quite:

 * recursively walking objects and sorting their keys before

 *
 * Arrays keep their original order (reordering them would change
 * semantics). Numbers, strings, booleans, and `null` use the default
 * JSON encoding. `undefined` and functions are rejected — ledger
 * entries are plain data, and silently dropping `undefined` would
 * break the "same input → same hash" property if a caller forgot to
 * omit a field.
 *
 * Performance: one pass per nesting level; O(n log n) for key sorting
 * at each object. Entries are small (< 1 KB) so this is negligible
 * compared to the sha256 call.
