   *
   * Stores that cannot implement `listVaults` cheaply or

   * the store has, not just the ones the caller can access. The
   * existence-leak filtering (returning only compartments whose
   * keyring the caller can unwrap) happens in core, not in the
   * store. The store is trusted to know its own contents — that
   * is not a leak in the threat model. The leak the API guards
   * against is the *return value* of `listAccessibleVaults()`
   * exposing existence to a downstream observer who only sees that
   * function's output.
