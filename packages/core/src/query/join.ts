/**
 * Query DSL `.join()` — eager, single-FK, intra-compartment joins.
 *
 * v0.6 #73 — resolves a ref()-declared foreign key into an attached
 * right-side record under an alias, using one of two planner paths
 * selected automatically:
 *
 *   - **nested-loop** — right-side source exposes `lookupById`, so
 *     each left row costs O(1). This is the common path for joins
 *     against a Collection, which backs `lookupById` with a Map
 *     lookup.
 *   - **hash** — right-side has only `snapshot()`. Build a
 *     `Map<id, record>` once, probe per left row. Same asymptotic
 *     cost for our collections, but the path exists as a fallback
 *     for custom QuerySource implementations and as an explicit
 *     test-only override via `{ strategy: 'hash' }`.
 *
 * Scope for v0.6:
 *
 *   - Equi-joins on declared `ref()` fields only. Joins on
 *     undeclared fields throw at plan time with an actionable error
 *     naming the field and collection.
 *   - Same-compartment only. Cross-compartment correlation goes
 *     through `queryAcross` (#63); this is an architectural
 *     invariant, not a limitation we plan to lift.
 *   - Hard row ceiling via `JoinTooLargeError` — default 50k per
 *     side, override via `{ maxRows }`. Warns at 80% of the ceiling
 *     on the existing warn channel.
 *   - Three ref-mode behaviors on dangling refs:
 *     strict → `DanglingReferenceError`,
 *     warn → attach `null` with a one-shot warning,
 *     cascade → attach `null` silently (cascade is a delete-time
 *     mode; any dangling refs still present at read time are
 *     mid-flight cascades or orphans from earlier, not a DSL error).
 *
 * Partition-awareness seam (#87 constraint #1):
 *
 * Every `JoinLeg` carries a `partitionScope` field that is always
 * `'all'` in v0.6. The executor never reads this field. v0.10
 * partition-aware joins will start populating it from `where()`
 * predicates on the partition key without changing the planner's
 * external shape — this is the whole reason it exists now.
 *
 * Joins stay OUT of the ledger: reads don't touch `_ledger/`,
 * including joined reads.

 * (structural sharing is fine for the inner fields, but the
 * top-level object is a fresh clone so consumers can further mutate
 * safely).
