  /**
   * Enumerate every compartment the calling principal can unwrap,
   * optionally filtered by minimum role.
   *
   * The walk is a two-step pipeline: first ask the adapter for the
   * universe of compartments it stores, then for each one attempt to
   * load the calling user's keyring with the in-memory passphrase.
   * Compartments where the user has no keyring file (`NoAccessError`)
   * or where the passphrase doesn't unwrap (`InvalidKeyError`) are
   * silently dropped from the result — the existence of those
   * compartments is **not** confirmed in the return value.
   *
   * Requires the optional `NoydbAdapter.listCompartments()` capability.
   * Throws `AdapterCapabilityError` against adapters that don't
   * implement it (today: dynamo, s3, browser). For those backends the
   * consumer should either pass an explicit candidate list to
   * `queryAcross()` directly, or maintain a compartment index out of
   * band.
   *
   * **Privacy note.** This method's return value never reveals the
   * existence of a compartment the caller cannot unwrap. The adapter
   * sees the enumeration call (it has to — it owns the storage), but
   * downstream consumers of `listAccessibleCompartments()` only see
   * the filtered list. That's the boundary the existence-leak
   * guarantee draws.
   *
   * **Known v0.4 edge case.** A compartment whose keyring file
   * happens to have an empty wrapped-DEKs map (because the owner
   * granted access before any collection was created) will pass the
   * `loadKeyring` probe with *any* passphrase — there are no DEKs to
   * unwrap, so the integrity-checked unwrap that normally rejects
   * wrong passphrases never runs. The result is that an unrelated
   * principal who happens to know the user-id and the compartment
   * name can show up in `listAccessibleCompartments()` as having
   * access to that empty compartment. They cannot read any actual
   * data (their DEK set is empty), so this is a metadata leak
   * (compartment name + user-id), not a content leak. Hardening this
   * via a passphrase canary in the keyring file is tracked as a
   * v0.6+ follow-up.
   *
   * **Cost.** O(compartments × keyring-load) — one `loadKeyring`
   * attempt per compartment in the universe. Each attempt does one
   * adapter `get` + one PBKDF2 derivation + N AES-KW unwraps. For
   * dozens of compartments this is fine; for thousands the consumer
   * should cache the result and refresh on grant/revoke events. A
   * future optimization could batch the keyring reads via
   * `loadAll('_keyring')` if such a thing existed at the adapter
   * layer, but the v0.5 contract doesn't expose that.
   *
   * @example
   * ```ts
   * // All compartments I can unwrap
   * const all = await db.listAccessibleCompartments()
   *
   * // Only compartments where I'm at least admin
   * const admin = await db.listAccessibleCompartments({ minRole: 'admin' })
