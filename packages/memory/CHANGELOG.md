# @noy-db/memory

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- **`listCompartments()` capability** (#63). Implements the new optional 7th adapter method introduced in `@noy-db/core@0.5.0`. Returns the outer Map's keys — O(compartments) and cheap. Used by `Noydb.listAccessibleCompartments()` to enumerate the compartment universe before filtering down to the ones the calling principal can unwrap.

- **Unified version line refresh.** Bumped to 0.5.0 alongside the rest of the `@noy-db/*` family so that fresh tarballs declare `peerDependencies: "@noy-db/core": "^0.5.0"`. Without this refresh, consumers installing the 0.4.1 tarball alongside `@noy-db/core@0.5.0` would hit `ERESOLVE` — in 0.x semver, caret ranges are locked to the minor (`^0.4.1` = `>=0.4.1 <0.5.0`), so every cross-minor release requires republishing every adapter with the updated peer range. This is the same pattern we established in the v0.4.1 peer-dep fix.

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- **Peer dep fix**: changed `peerDependencies` spec from `workspace:*` to `workspace:^` so published packages accept any semver-compatible `@noy-db/*` version rather than pinning to the exact version the workspace was built against. Without this fix, installing `@noy-db/core@0.4.0` alongside `@noy-db/memory@0.3.0` produced an `ERESOLVE` error because memory's peer dep was published as the literal `"0.3.0"` string.

- **Version line unified**: every `@noy-db/*` package is now on the **0.4.1** line. Previously the line was mixed (core/pinia on 0.4.0, adapters on 0.3.0, vue on 0.2.0, create on 0.3.2). No functional code changes — this is a manifest-only release to make v0.4 actually installable.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Implement the optional `listPage` adapter capability (closes #14). Cursor format: numeric offset.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Versioned in lockstep with `@noy-db/core@0.2.0` (privacy cleanup + release-pipeline hardening, no API changes in this package).

Previous `0.1.x` versions have been deprecated on npm. Please install `>=0.2.0`.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @noy-db/core@0.2.0

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Align folder names with npm package names and bring metadata to state-of-the-art quality.

  **Folder rename (no code changes):**

  - `packages/adapter-browser` → `packages/browser`
  - `packages/adapter-dynamo` → `packages/dynamo`
  - `packages/adapter-file` → `packages/file`
  - `packages/adapter-memory` → `packages/memory`
  - `packages/adapter-s3` → `packages/s3`

  **package.json metadata improvements:**

  - Added `author`, `homepage`, `bugs` fields to every package
  - Added `sideEffects: false` for proper tree-shaking
  - Added comprehensive `keywords` to every package (previously only `@noy-db/core` had any)
  - Fixed descriptions — replaced "NOYDB" with "noy-db"
  - Fixed all `repository.directory` paths after folder rename
  - Fixed `homepage` URLs — previously pointed to the old `noydb` repo

  **New per-package READMEs:**
  Every published package now ships with its own `README.md` and `LICENSE`, so npmjs.com displays proper documentation instead of a blank page.

  **GitHub Actions:**

  - Release workflow now supports two paths: changesets-driven (push to main) and release-event-driven (manual GitHub Release)
  - Publishes now include npm provenance attestations for supply-chain verification
  - `createGithubReleases: true` enabled on the changesets action

  No API or runtime behavior changes.

- Updated dependencies
  - @noy-db/core@0.1.1
